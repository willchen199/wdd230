            <p>The Hong Kong China Temple (Chinese: 中國香港聖殿), formerly the Hong Kong Temple, is the 48th operating temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

                The LDS Church first sent missionaries to Hong Kong in 1853. Almost 140 years later, in 1992, then-First Counselor in the First Presidency, Gordon B. Hinckley, announced plans to build a temple in the territory. Finding a site on which to build, however, proved difficult, especially given the high cost of real estate in the area. Finally, it was decided that the temple would be built on the site of the existing mission home and chapel.</p>
